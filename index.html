			<h1 style="font-size: 40px;">About Me</h1>
			<h2>What's this website for?</h2>
			<p>Hi! My name is Hoo Jia Yi and this website is created for my school's individual assignment, the module named Interactive Development. 
				I'm a year 1 student in School of ICT of Ngee Ann Polytechnic. The requirement of this assignment is to design a front-end 
				responsive website while the theme or topic choosing is depend on ourselves. Actually it just took me a while to think of this topic, 
				fun facts and jokes. But it took me some time to search on it online and finally decided to implement this topic to my website. 
			</p><br><br>
			<h2>Why Funfacts and Jokes?</h2>
			<p>When I heard of the term "responsive website" for the first time, what i think about it is this website should be an interesting 
				website and it can make user feel happy or comfortable when using it from various aspect such as the visual impact, interface, words and buttons. 
				It sounds nice to be able to create an successfull responsive website but honestly I don't think that my skill can do all the fancy thing. 
				So, what I do is think about the content of website, because i think that fun facts and jokes can be interesting to everyone and it can 
				makes people happy too. What's more important is when i search online for fun facts and jokes, most of the websites's interface are crowded 
				with many other things such as advertisements and it really makes me hard to focus on the words. Moreover, when i search for jokes, actually 
				i don't think that they are funny and it really took me a lot of time to choose some of the jokes that i think is ok, funny but i'm still 
				unsatisfied by the jokes quality. So, this website is also created to gather some interesting fun facts and jokes to make it more easier to read. 
				It is really fun actually for me to research on the fun facts that i don't know before and their main character as most of it is 
				really cute! Of course with beautiful pictures, I took some time for searhing and choosing each of the picture and i like everyone of it.
				<span style="font-size: 10px;">(Beside insects)</span></p>
				<p>That's all from me and hope you enjoy your day.</p>
