# ASG1
This is my Asignment Project 1 for Interactive Development module about the front-end development.
For this asignment, I'm thinking of create a website that's include some fun/interesting facts of the world or daily life and maybe some Funny Jokes to make user laugh.

### External userâ€™s goal:

The site's users can be some fans of jokes or people who curious about things that they don't know.

### Site owner's goal:

To find some interesting facts and jokes, i like it and want to make user happy with my website.

Potential features to include:
* Maybe some greetings for user.
* Photos or video clips for the jokes and fun facts.
* Rating features for the jokes and facts.
* Provide links to external resources.
* Provide a feature that user can upload their jokes or fun facts.
* Maybe i'll include a guessing session some the fun facts(giving 4 option etc.), but user can skip it and see the answer if they want.
* I'm thinking of include a bookmark feature.
* Create some category for fun facts(Animal, building, country etc.).
* Comment feature??
* Feedback on website.
* Background of website.
* Maybe a filter feature.
