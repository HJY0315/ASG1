# ASG1
This is my Asignment Project 1 for Interactive Development module about the front-end development.
For this asignment, I'm thinking of create a website that's include some fun/interesting facts of the world or daily life and maybe some Funny Jokes to make user laugh.

### External userâ€™s goal:

The site's users can be some fans of jokes or people who curious about things that they don't know.

### Site owner's goal:

To find some interesting facts and jokes, i like it and want to make user happy with my website.

Potential features to include:
* Maybe some greetings for user.
* Photos or video clips for the jokes and fun facts.
* Provide links to external resources.
* Background of website.
* Navigation.
* About page.
* Contact info,email etc.
* Website name.
* A home button.
