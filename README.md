# ASG1
This is my Asignment Project 1 for Interactive Development module about the front-end development.

I'm to design and develop a responsive website for a company revamp (real or fictional) or a fictional company site of my own.

For this asignment, I'm thinking of create a website that's include some fun/interesting facts of the world or daily life and maybe some Funny Jokes to make user laugh.

### External userâ€™s goal:

The site's users can be some fans of jokes or people with curiosity about fun facts. Or maybe some people who just want to laugh.

### Site owner's goal:

To find some jokes and make myself laugh and can widen my knowledge.

Potential features to include:
* Maybe some greetings for user.
* Photos or video clips of jokes.
* Rating features for the jokes and facts.
* Provide links to external resources.

### Suggested Javascript features to include:
* Micro interactions when interacting with the site eg, clicking on an interactable area
to show some animation, mouse over interactions, scrolling interactions when
interacting with the site.
* An input box to allow users to enter something.

### GUIDING FACTORS
The full design is implemented providing a good solution to the users' demands and
expectations.

Thinking points
* Is the web site sound and fits the audience intent?
* Have you tested across browsers?
* Is the website developed as close to what was proposed in the wireframe and
documentation?
* Is the navigation structure sound?

Real world application
* Clearly understandable site-specific content is used rather than Lorem Ipsum
placeholder text
* All links to external pages open in a separate tab when clicked
* The final application is aligned to the user stories presented at the start of the project
* Testing procedures are comprehensive, with a good level of coverage, and have
clearly been followed. All noticeable errors have been corrected or documented.

Version control systems are used effectively:
* all code is managed in git with well-described commit messages
* there is a separate, well-defined commit for each individual feature/fit
* there are no very large commits which make it harder to understand the development
process and could lead the assessor to suspect plagiarism

The full application development process is documented:
* the purpose of the application is clearly described in the README
* the project's documentation describes the design work undertaken for this project
and the reasoning behind it
* wireframes, mockups, diagrams, etc., created as part of the design process are
included in the project
